                 <h2 style="color: #204051; padding-bottom: 5vh;">Beyond the Mute Button: The Art of Listening in Virtual Teams</h2>
                 <p style="font-size: 18px;">Over the past
        A few months ago, while working with an ed-tech company in a remote environment, I realised just how crucial <strong>listening</strong> becomes when collaborating with a virtual team. Our days typically began with a Google Meet and ended with another to wrap things up. Over time, I noticed how easily avoidable conflicts would surface, often because someone overlooked or dismissed what another person was trying to say.
      </p>

      <p style="font-size: 18px;">
        Listening is always important, but in a remote setup, its significance becomes even more critical. I often sensed that collaboration wasn’t as effective as it could be. Why was that?
      </p>

      <p style="font-size: 18px;">
        After several avoidable misunderstandings and conflicts, I realised that <strong>poor listening</strong> was a major factor. Sometimes it’s as simple as someone being muted, distracted, or juggling too many things at once.
      </p>

      <p style="font-size: 18px;">
        While everyone working remotely faces their own challenges, it’s especially important for <strong>managers</strong> to foster strong communication and ensure that the team stays connected and collaborates effectively to achieve the best outcomes.
      </p>

      <p style="font-size: 18px;">
        Researchers estimate that we only remember <strong>25–50%</strong> of what we hear. To be successful at your remote work, you have to hone this skill to its maximum. In my opinion, listening in a remote environment can <em>make or break</em> relationships at work.
      </p>

      <p style="font-size: 18px;">
        First, listening helps you grasp the subject at hand and absorb key information. Second—and often more importantly—it helps you <strong>understand people better</strong>, which is essential for building strong relationships.
      </p>

      <p style="font-size: 18px;">
        While many people excel at the first part, they often fall short on the second. This becomes even more apparent in remote settings, where we lose the nonverbal cues that come naturally in face-to-face conversations. You can't read facial expressions or interpret body language through a screen, which makes <strong>intentional listening</strong> all the more important.
      </p>

      <p style="font-size: 18px;">
        However, managers who’ve already developed strong listening skills often assume they’re doing just fine. But things shift in a virtual team. Surprisingly, some of those well-practised listening and interpersonal skills don’t translate as effectively in a remote environment—they simply don’t work the same way.
